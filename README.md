# E02a-Operators
An exercise exploring python operators and data types

---
This program demonstrates various Python operations with variables a1 and a2. It explores the lists functions, string functions, and random number opertators. The program prints all the values and showcases how the functions and operators work.

For this exercise, you will need to edit main.py. The file is broken into many functions (def blocks), each of which is designed to perform a basic operation. Many of these are arithmetic, some work with lists or strings, and others produce random values.

To help you along, I have implemented the add function. Also, here are a few online resources that might be useful:
